You can feel me beside you, my feathers against your skull and ear. My voice inside your inside voice. I slip in close beside your consciousness. So smooth and stealthy you didn’t notice before this moment. So now draw back the shades that obscure your own lucidity from you. I cannot be called for by your tongue or your wishing in the cold night, but I’ll push words through your pores. I am always watching those who cannot watch themselves.',

It is no different.” “It’s mine, that’s all.” “There’s something funny about you.” There was something funny about her too and, as I handed her back the rest of the money, I had the sudden urge to kiss her again.',

The train peels away and Peter cranes his neck but all he catches is the flick of the man’s head and the flight of another as it arcs in a flurry of feathers and blood to land beak-down in the leaves.',

The waves ate them like ship’s crackers, without delight or comment but only the necessity of sustenance. I watched them sink. The sea closed over them like history.',
